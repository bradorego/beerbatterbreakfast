        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;"><a href="http://houseofbrewsmadison.com/">House of Brews</a> is the Madison Homebrewer's favorite success story. HoB's owner, Page Buchanan, used to be a hobbyist homebrewer (like <a href="http://mhtg.org/">many of us</a>), and started brewing a handful of years ago. As his interest, skill, and passion for brewing grew, he started brewing larger and larger batches, buying more and more equipment, and getting a lot of good reviews on his product. In 2011, he finally decided to take the leap and start a brewery. House of Brews is Wisconsin's first Community Supported Brewery (CSB).</span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">
            <br />
        </span>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">I first met Page at the <a href="http://madisoncurlingclub.com/">Madison Curling Club</a>'s Fowler Event, where he had brought several of his beers for us to enjoy during the event. I actually helped him set up his equipment before knowing who he was or what was going on. I ran into Page again at a beer tasting at <a href="http://www.starliquor.com/">Star Liquor</a> and decided to grab a growler of his new Cellar Dark.</span>
        <br />
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">
            <br />
        </span>
        <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Cellar Dark is a "light-bodied English Style Brown Porter dominated by flavors of chocolate and coffee". That I can personally attest to, as (while my growler was a few weeks old, so a little flat), it has a deliciously dark, malty, chocolatey flavor. I'm a huge fan of the Cellar Dark (which is good, because I bought the growler before tasting it. That, my friends, is faith in your brewery).</span>
        <br />
        <h4 style="text-align: left;">
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">Prep/Cooking:</span>
        </h4>
        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The Cellar Dark's choclatey aroma is probably the first thing you'll notice about the beer (well, aside from its color, of course). It's a rich and sweet smell that fills your nostrils, and offers as a great precursor to what the beer you're about to enjoy will be like. Cellar Dark's batter was no different, keeping its wonderful rich darkness (in both color and smell/flavor). The sweetness and richness of the batter really complimented this brew, and it didn't taste yeasty at all (which often happens in batter form).</span>

        <div>
            <span style="font-family: Verdana, sans-serif;">The pancakes came out wonderfully dark in color, reminding me of some of the other dark beers I've used over the
                <strike>years</strike>months. The pancakes themselves were quite delicious, despite having those rich malty tones drop off quite a bit in pancake form. They held a certain mysterious subtlety to them, which is an interesting twist on how these pancakes tend to go.</span>

For whatever reason, the sweetness of the syrup really brought out the complexities of flavor in the beer/pancake/beerpancake. I'd almost say you should only eat these with syrup, as they're so much better with it than without.</span>
